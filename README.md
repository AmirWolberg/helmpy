## Required software

To use the Python library I provided, you will need to have the following things installed:

- Python: The Python programming language, which the library is written in. You can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

- Go: The Go programming language, which the `helm` package is written in. You can download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).

- `gopy`: A tool for generating Python bindings for Go packages. You can install `gopy` by running the following command:

pip install gopy

Copy code

- The `helm` package: The `helm` package provides a set of functions and types for interacting with Tiller, the in-cluster server that Helm uses to manage releases (installations) of charts on a Kubernetes cluster. To install the `helm` package, you will need to use the `go get` command:

go get github.com/helm/helm/pkg/helm

Copy code

This will download and install the `helm` package to your Go workspace.

Once you have these things installed, you should be able to use the Python library I provided to install and uninstall Helm charts.
